    "question": "What is the greenhouse effect?",
    "answer": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun. When sunlight reaches Earth, some is reflected back to space, but most is absorbed by the surface. Earth then radiates this energy as heat. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor absorb this heat and re-emit it in all directions, including back toward Earth. This process keeps Earth about 33°C warmer than it would be without these gases, making life possible.",

    "question": "What is the enhanced greenhouse effect?",
    "answer": "The enhanced greenhouse effect occurs when human activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere beyond natural levels. This extra layer of greenhouse gases traps more heat than the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperatures to rise. The main culprit is carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, which has increased atmospheric CO2 by over 40% since pre-industrial times.",

    "question": "What is the difference between weather and climate?",
    "answer": "Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific place at a specific time, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind on a particular day. Climate, however, describes the long-term average weather patterns in a region over decades or centuries. Think of it this way: climate is what you expect, weather is what you get. For example, you expect hot summers in Arizona (climate), but any single day might be cooler than average (weather).",

    "answer": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that occurs naturally in Earth's atmosphere. It's crucial for climate because it's a greenhouse gas that traps heat. Plants use CO2 for photosynthesis, and animals produce it when breathing. However, human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, have increased atmospheric CO2 by over 40% since pre-industrial times. This extra CO2 enhances the greenhouse effect, causing global temperatures to rise.",

Carbon is exchanged through photosynthesis (plants absorb CO2), respiration (organisms release CO2), ocean absorption, volcanic emissions, and decomposition. Human activities have disrupted this natural cycle by adding extra CO2 through fossil fuel burning and deforestation, leading to more carbon in the atmosphere than natural processes can remove.",

Since the late 1800s, the average global temperature has risen by about 1.1°C (2°F), with most of this warming occurring in the past 40 years.

    "question": "What is climate feedback?",
    "answer": "Climate feedback occurs when changes in the climate system trigger additional changes that either amplify (positive feedback) or reduce (negative feedback) the original change. For example, as ice melts due to warming, it exposes darker surfaces that absorb more heat, causing more warming and melting - this is positive feedback. Cloud formation can provide negative feedback by reflecting sunlight back to space. Understanding feedbacks is crucial for predicting future climate changes.",

Light-colored surfaces like ice and snow have high albedo (reflect most sunlight), while dark surfaces like forests and oceans have low albedo (absorb most sunlight). As global warming melts ice and snow, it exposes darker surfaces underneath, which absorb more heat and cause additional warming. This creates a positive feedback loop that accelerates climate change.",

The main types are coal, oil (petroleum), and natural gas. When burned for energy, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that were stored underground. This is the primary source of human-caused climate change, as we're essentially releasing millions of years worth of stored carbon back into the atmosphere in just a few centuries.",

It comes from natural sources like wetlands and human activities including agriculture (especially livestock), landfills, and natural gas production. While methane makes up a smaller percentage of total emissions than CO2, its high warming potential makes it a critical target for climate action. The good news is that methane breaks down faster in the atmosphere than CO2.",

Additionally, glaciers and ice sheets on land are melting, adding water to the oceans. Global sea levels have risen about 8-9 inches since 1880, with the rate of increase accelerating in recent decades. This threatens coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems worldwide.",

    "answer": "Climate change impacts wildlife and ecosystems by altering habitats, food sources, and migration patterns. Rising temperatures force species to migrate to cooler areas or higher elevations. Changing precipitation affects water availability. Ocean acidification harms marine life with shells and skeletons. Timing mismatches occur when species' life cycles no longer align with their food sources. Some species adapt, but many face extinction, leading to biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption.",

    "question": "What is ocean acidification?",
    "answer": "Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making seawater more acidic. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of human-produced CO2, which lowers the pH of seawater. This makes it harder for marine organisms like corals, shellfish, and some plankton to build their calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Ocean acidification is sometimes called \"the other CO2 problem\" and threatens marine food webs.",

Once crossed, these tipping points can lead to cascading effects and accelerated warming.

    "question": "In what way does climate change affect Arctic ice?",
    "answer": "Climate change is dramatically affecting Arctic ice, with Arctic sea ice declining at a rate of about 13% per decade. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average, a phenomenon called Arctic amplification. This ice loss reduces the Earth's ability to reflect sunlight, creating a feedback loop that accelerates warming. Melting Arctic ice contributes to sea level rise and disrupts global weather patterns and ocean currents.",

    "question": "Can you explain coral bleaching?",
    "answer": "Coral bleaching occurs when coral polyps expel the algae living in their tissues due to stress, primarily from rising ocean temperatures. The algae provide corals with food through photosynthesis, so when they're expelled, corals turn white (bleach) and can starve. While corals can recover if conditions improve, repeated or severe bleaching events can kill entire reef systems. Ocean acidification also weakens coral skeletons, making reefs more vulnerable.",

    "answer": "Renewable energy sources are naturally replenishing resources that don't run out when used. The main types are: 1) Solar energy from sunlight; 2) Wind energy from moving air; 3) Hydroelectric power from flowing water; 4) Geothermal energy from Earth's heat; 5) Biomass from organic materials; and 6) Tidal energy from ocean movements. These sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, making them crucial for reducing climate change.",

    "answer": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that captures CO2 emissions from industrial sources before they enter the atmosphere and stores them underground or in other long-term storage. The process involves three steps: capturing CO2 from emissions sources, transporting it to storage sites, and injecting it into geological formations. CCS can help reduce emissions from power plants and industrial facilities while renewable energy scales up.",

    "answer": "Forests help fight climate change by acting as carbon sinks - they absorb CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and store it in trees and soil. A single mature tree can absorb 48 pounds of CO2 per year. Forests also provide cooling through evapotranspiration, regulate water cycles, and support biodiversity. Protecting existing forests and planting new ones are important climate solutions, but forest management must be sustainable to be effective.",
