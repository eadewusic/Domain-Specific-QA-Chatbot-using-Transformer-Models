What is the greenhouse effect?,"The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun. When sunlight reaches Earth, some is reflected back to space, but most is absorbed by the surface. Earth then radiates this energy as heat. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor absorb this heat and re-emit it in all directions, including back toward Earth. This process keeps Earth about 33°C warmer than it would be without these gases, making life possible.",basic_concepts,beginner,manual_curation,climate_qa_001,81,494,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What is the enhanced greenhouse effect?,"The enhanced greenhouse effect occurs when human activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere beyond natural levels. This extra layer of greenhouse gases traps more heat than the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperatures to rise. The main culprit is carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, which has increased atmospheric CO2 by over 40% since pre-industrial times.",basic_concepts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_002,60,411,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What is the difference between weather and climate?,"Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific place at a specific time, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind on a particular day. Climate, however, describes the long-term average weather patterns in a region over decades or centuries. Think of it this way: climate is what you expect, weather is what you get. For example, you expect hot summers in Arizona (climate), but any single day might be cooler than average (weather).",basic_concepts,beginner,manual_curation,climate_qa_003,73,455,2024-12-01,manual_creation

What is climate feedback?,"Climate feedback occurs when changes in the climate system trigger additional changes that either amplify (positive feedback) or reduce (negative feedback) the original change. For example, as ice melts due to warming, it exposes darker surfaces that absorb more heat, causing more warming and melting - this is positive feedback. Cloud formation can provide negative feedback by reflecting sunlight back to space. Understanding feedbacks is crucial for predicting future climate changes.",basic_concepts,advanced,manual_curation,climate_qa_009,71,488,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What is the albedo effect?,"The albedo effect refers to how much sunlight a surface reflects back to space. Light-colored surfaces like ice and snow have high albedo (reflect most sunlight), while dark surfaces like forests and oceans have low albedo (absorb most sunlight). As global warming melts ice and snow, it exposes darker surfaces underneath, which absorb more heat and cause additional warming. This creates a positive feedback loop that accelerates climate change.",basic_concepts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_010,69,447,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What are fossil fuels?,"Fossil fuels are energy sources formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried and compressed over millions of years. The main types are coal, oil (petroleum), and natural gas. When burned for energy, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that were stored underground. This is the primary source of human-caused climate change, as we're essentially releasing millions of years worth of stored carbon back into the atmosphere in just a few centuries.",basic_concepts,beginner,manual_curation,climate_qa_011,77,488,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What is methane and why is it important for climate?,"Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. It comes from natural sources like wetlands and human activities including agriculture (especially livestock), landfills, and natural gas production. While methane makes up a smaller percentage of total emissions than CO2, its high warming potential makes it a critical target for climate action. The good news is that methane breaks down faster in the atmosphere than CO2.",basic_concepts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_012,81,513,2024-12-01,manual_creation
How does climate change affect sea levels?,"Climate change causes sea levels to rise through two main processes: thermal expansion and ice melting. As ocean water warms, it expands, taking up more space. Additionally, glaciers and ice sheets on land are melting, adding water to the oceans.

How does climate change affect wildlife and ecosystems?,"Climate change impacts wildlife and ecosystems by altering habitats, food sources, and migration patterns. Rising temperatures force species to migrate to cooler areas or higher elevations. Changing precipitation affects water availability. Ocean acidification harms marine life with shells and skeletons. Timing mismatches occur when species' life cycles no longer align with their food sources. Some species adapt, but many face extinction, leading to biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_015,68,497,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What is ocean acidification?,"Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making seawater more acidic. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of human-produced CO2, which lowers the pH of seawater. This makes it harder for marine organisms like corals, shellfish, and some plankton to build their calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Ocean acidification is sometimes called ""the other CO2 problem"" and threatens marine food webs.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_016,67,445,2024-12-01,manual_creation
How does climate change affect extreme weather?,"Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.

These changes threaten water security for drinking, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_020,62,470,2024-12-01,manual_creation
How does climate change affect Arctic ice?,"Climate change is dramatically affecting Arctic ice, with Arctic sea ice declining at a rate of about 13% per decade. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average, a phenomenon called Arctic amplification. This ice loss reduces the Earth's ability to reflect sunlight, creating a feedback loop that accelerates warming. Melting Arctic ice contributes to sea level rise and disrupts global weather patterns and ocean currents.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_021,69,438,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What is coral bleaching?,"Coral bleaching occurs when coral polyps expel the algae living in their tissues due to stress, primarily from rising ocean temperatures. The algae provide corals with food through photosynthesis, so when they're expelled, corals turn white (bleach) and can starve. While corals can recover if conditions improve, repeated or severe bleaching events can kill entire reef systems. Ocean acidification also weakens coral skeletons, making reefs more vulnerable.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_022,67,459,2024-12-01,manual_creation

Can you list fossil fuels?,"Fossil fuels are energy sources formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried and compressed over millions of years. The main types are coal, oil (petroleum), and natural gas. When burned for energy, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that were stored underground. This is the primary source of human-caused climate change, as we're essentially releasing millions of years worth of stored carbon back into the atmosphere in just a few centuries.",basic_concepts,beginner,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_059,77,488,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you explain methane and why is it important for climate?,"Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. It comes from natural sources like wetlands and human activities including agriculture (especially livestock), landfills, and natural gas production. While methane makes up a smaller percentage of total emissions than CO2, its high warming potential makes it a critical target for climate action. The good news is that methane breaks down faster in the atmosphere than CO2.",basic_concepts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_060,81,513,2024-12-01,manual_creation
In what way does climate change affect sea levels?,"Climate change causes sea levels to rise through two main processes: thermal expansion and ice melting. As ocean water warms, it expands, taking up more space. Additionally, glaciers and ice sheets on land are melting, adding water to the oceans. Global sea levels have risen about 8-9 inches since 1880, with the rate of increase accelerating in recent decades. This threatens coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems worldwide.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_061,67,440,2024-12-01,manual_creation

In what way does climate change affect wildlife and ecosystems?,"Climate change impacts wildlife and ecosystems by altering habitats, food sources, and migration patterns. Rising temperatures force species to migrate to cooler areas or higher elevations. Changing precipitation affects water availability. Ocean acidification harms marine life with shells and skeletons. Timing mismatches occur when species' life cycles no longer align with their food sources. Some species adapt, but many face extinction, leading to biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_063,68,497,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you explain ocean acidification?,"Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making seawater more acidic. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of human-produced CO2, which lowers the pH of seawater. This makes it harder for marine organisms like corals, shellfish, and some plankton to build their calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Ocean acidification is sometimes called ""the other CO2 problem"" and threatens marine food webs.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_064,67,445,2024-12-01,manual_creation
In what way does climate change affect extreme weather?,"Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.

Glaciers that serve as water towers for major rivers are shrinking. These changes threaten water security for drinking, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_068,62,470,2024-12-01,manual_creation
In what way does climate change affect Arctic ice?,"Climate change is dramatically affecting Arctic ice, with Arctic sea ice declining at a rate of about 13% per decade. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average, a phenomenon called Arctic amplification. This ice loss reduces the Earth's ability to reflect sunlight, creating a feedback loop that accelerates warming. Melting Arctic ice contributes to sea level rise and disrupts global weather patterns and ocean currents.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_069,69,438,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you explain coral bleaching?,"Coral bleaching occurs when coral polyps expel the algae living in their tissues due to stress, primarily from rising ocean temperatures. The algae provide corals with food through photosynthesis, so when they're expelled, corals turn white (bleach) and can starve. While corals can recover if conditions improve, repeated or severe bleaching events can kill entire reef systems. Ocean acidification also weakens coral skeletons, making reefs more vulnerable.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_070,67,459,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you list renewable energy sources?,"Renewable energy sources are naturally replenishing resources that don't run out when used.
