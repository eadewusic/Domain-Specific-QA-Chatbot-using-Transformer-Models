How do we know climate change is happening?,"We know climate change is happening through multiple lines of evidence: 1) Temperature records show warming trends since the 1880s; 2) Ice core data reveals atmospheric CO2 levels are higher than any time in 800,000 years; 3) Glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking globally; 4) Sea levels are rising; 5) Ocean temperatures are increasing; 6) Seasonal patterns are shifting; and 7) Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. This evidence comes from thousands of scientists worldwide using independent measurement methods.",basic_concepts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_005,80,528,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What are carbon offsets?,"Carbon offsets are reductions in greenhouse gas emissions made to compensate for emissions produced elsewhere. Examples include planting trees, investing in renewable energy projects, or supporting methane capture from landfills. One carbon offset represents one metric ton of CO2 equivalent removed or prevented. While useful, offsets should supplement, not replace, direct emission reductions.",solutions,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_034,53,395,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you list electric vehicles and how do they help climate?,"Electric vehicles (EVs) use electric motors powered by batteries instead of internal combustion engines. They produce zero direct emissions and can significantly reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, especially when charged with renewable electricity. Even when accounting for electricity generation and battery production, EVs typically produce about half the lifetime emissions of conventional cars. As the electricity grid becomes cleaner, EVs become even more climate-friendly.",solutions,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_076,64,499,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What is the albedo effect?,"The albedo effect refers to how much sunlight a surface reflects back to space. Light-colored surfaces like ice and snow have high albedo (reflect most sunlight), while dark surfaces like forests and oceans have low albedo (absorb most sunlight). As global warming melts ice and snow, it exposes darker surfaces underneath, which absorb more heat and cause additional warming. This creates a positive feedback loop that accelerates climate change.",basic_concepts,intermediate,manual_curation,climate_qa_010,69,447,2024-12-01,manual_creation
In what way does climate change affect extreme weather?,"Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Warmer air holds more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall and flooding. Higher temperatures contribute to more severe droughts and heat waves. Warmer ocean temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes and typhoons. Changing atmospheric patterns can cause more persistent weather patterns, leading to prolonged droughts or extended periods of extreme heat.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_065,59,430,2024-12-01,manual_creation
In what way does climate change affect water resources?,"Climate change affects water resources through altered precipitation patterns, increased evaporation, and changing snow and ice patterns. Some regions experience more frequent droughts, while others face increased flooding. Mountain snowpack, which provides water for billions of people, is declining. Glaciers that serve as water towers for major rivers are shrinking. These changes threaten water security for drinking, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation.",impacts,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_068,62,470,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you explain the Paris Agreement?,"The Paris Agreement is an international treaty adopted in 2015 where countries commit to limiting global warming to well below 2째C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5째C. Each country sets its own climate targets (Nationally Determined Contributions) and reports on progress. The agreement includes provisions for climate finance to help developing countries. Nearly 200 countries have signed, making it the most comprehensive global climate agreement.",solutions,intermediate,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_074,69,476,2024-12-01,manual_creation
What is the greenhouse effect?,"The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun. When sunlight reaches Earth, some is reflected back to space, but most is absorbed by the surface. Earth then radiates this energy as heat. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor absorb this heat and re-emit it in all directions, including back toward Earth. This process keeps Earth about 33째C warmer than it would be without these gases, making life possible.",basic_concepts,beginner,manual_curation,climate_qa_001,81,494,2024-12-01,manual_creation

Can you explain climate feedback?,"Climate feedback occurs when changes in the climate system trigger additional changes that either amplify (positive feedback) or reduce (negative feedback) the original change. For example, as ice melts due to warming, it exposes darker surfaces that absorb more heat, causing more warming and melting - this is positive feedback. Cloud formation can provide negative feedback by reflecting sunlight back to space. Understanding feedbacks is crucial for predicting future climate changes.",basic_concepts,advanced,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_057,71,488,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you list renewable energy sources?,"Renewable energy sources are naturally replenishing resources that don't run out when used. The main types are: 1) Solar energy from sunlight; 2) Wind energy from moving air; 3) Hydroelectric power from flowing water; 4) Geothermal energy from Earth's heat; 5) Biomass from organic materials; and 6) Tidal energy from ocean movements. These sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, making them crucial for reducing climate change.",solutions,beginner,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_071,70,461,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you explain carbon dioxide and why is it important for climate?,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that occurs naturally in Earth's atmosphere. It's crucial for climate because it's a greenhouse gas that traps heat. Plants use CO2 for photosynthesis, and animals produce it when breathing. However, human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, have increased atmospheric CO2 by over 40% since pre-industrial times. This extra CO2 enhances the greenhouse effect, causing global temperatures to rise.",basic_concepts,beginner,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_054,66,455,2024-12-01,manual_creation
Can you list climate tipping points?,"Climate tipping points are thresholds in the climate system where small changes trigger large, often irreversible shifts. Examples include the collapse of ice sheets, shutdown of ocean currents, dieback of forests, or thawing of permafrost. Once crossed, these tipping points can lead to cascading effects and accelerated warming. Scientists have identified several potential tipping points that could be reached with 1.5-2째C of warming, making rapid emission reductions crucial.",impacts,advanced,manual_curation_variation,climate_qa_067,68,479,2024-12-01,manual_creation
