## Why 'Climate Education' as Domain?

**Despite being a solvable crisis, climate change is still held back by widespread public ignorance and misinformation about its causes and solutions, delaying the urgent action the planet desperately needs.** Climate education is key, yet it faces a major barrier: **complex scientific concepts** that often confuse or alienate people, leading to misinterpretation, apathy, or disengagement. Traditional educational resources often lack the **interactive, personalized approach** that todayâ€™s learners crave.
