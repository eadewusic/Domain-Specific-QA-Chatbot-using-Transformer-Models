## Why 'Climate Education' as Domain?

**Despite being a solvable crisis, climate change is still held back by widespread public ignorance and misinformation about its causes and solutions, delaying the urgent action the planet desperately needs.** Climate education is key, yet it faces a major barrier: **complex scientific concepts** that often confuse or alienate people, leading to misinterpretation, apathy, or disengagement. Traditional educational resources often lack the **interactive, personalized approach** that todayâ€™s learners crave.

## About the Dataset

**The Challenge:** Traditional web scraping from authoritative climate sources (NASA Climate Kids, NOAA Climate.gov, EPA, IPCC) yielded only 11 Q&A pairs (7 IPCC + 4 fallback content) which is way too small for training a transformer model effectively.

**The Solution:** Strategic pivot to expert manual curation resulted in 86 high-quality Q&A pairs specifically optimized for educational contexts.

**Dataset Files:**

### **Sample Dataset Entries**

**Beginner Level Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "climate_qa_001",
  "question": "What is global warming?",
  "answer": "Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities and natural factors. Since the late 1800s, the average global temperature has risen by about 1.1Â°C (2Â°F), with most of this warming occurring in the past 40 years. The primary cause is increased greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, which trap more heat in the atmosphere.",
  "category": "basic_concepts",
  "difficulty": "beginner",
  "source": "manual_curation",
  "word_count": 67
}
```

**Advanced Level Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "climate_qa_045",
  "question": "What are climate tipping points?",
  "answer": "Climate tipping points are thresholds in the climate system where small changes trigger large, often irreversible shifts. Examples include the collapse of ice sheets, shutdown of ocean currents, dieback of forests, or thawing of permafrost. Once crossed, these tipping points can lead to cascading effects and accelerated warming. Scientists have identified several potential tipping points that could be reached with 1.5-2Â°C of warming, making rapid emission reductions crucial.",
  "category": "impacts",
  "difficulty": "advanced",
  "source": "manual_curation",
  "word_count": 78
}
```

**Education-Specific Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "climate_qa_067",
  "question": "How can teachers explain climate change to young students?",
  "answer": "Teachers can explain climate change to young students using simple analogies, hands-on experiments, and relatable examples. Compare the greenhouse effect to a blanket keeping Earth warm, use a thermometer to show temperature changes, and relate impacts to local weather patterns. Visual aids like charts, videos, and interactive games help make abstract concepts concrete. Focus on solutions and positive actions students can take to feel empowered rather than overwhelmed.",
  "category": "solutions",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "source": "education_specific",
  "word_count": 73
}
```

## Model Analysis (T5-small) & Experiments

I chose to fine-tune this pre-trained Transformer model from Hugging Face called **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)**. I aimed for **Generative QA** than **Extractive QA** because I wanted a natural-sounding answer in its own words, not necessarily copying from the contex.

**Generative QA with T5:**

- T5 can generate answers from scratch (abstractive).
- Ability to answer even when the answer isn't directly extractable.
- The full encoder-decoder model is used for generative QA to achieve free-text human-like and conversational  responses.

**Why T5-Small for AyikaBot:**

- Manageable size for training and inference
- Good balance of performance vs. computational cost
- Suitable for domain-specific fine-tuning
- Fast enough for interactive applications

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, TFT5ForConditionalGeneration

# Load the fine-tuned model
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("Climi/Climate-Education-QA-Chatbot")
model = TFT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Climi/Climate-Education-QA-Chatbot")

# Generate climate education answers
def ask_climate_question(question):
    prompt = f"question: {question}"
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="tf")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=100, num_beams=4)
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
